*Most application today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive.*

In this chapter we will discuss about :

1. Reliablity: The system should keep on working correctly even after encountering software, hardware or human error.

2. Scalablity: If a system grows in terms of data, traffic or complexity there should be appropriate ways of dealing with it.

3. Maintainability: Over the time different people will work on the system, they should be able to work on it productively.


### Reliablity : 

By defination to be reliable means to be responsible of taking care of things one is supposed to.

So if terms of database systems,

    1. If an application performs the function it is supposed to,
    2. It can tolerate user making mistakes,
    3. It can perform good even in situations of high load,
    4. It make prevenet unauthorized access and abuse.

    Then that system is called reliable (somewhat), basically if the system is working correctly even when the things go wrong then it is reliable.


Here the things that can go wrong can be termed as fault and a reliable system can also be called *fault-torlerant* or *resilient*.
