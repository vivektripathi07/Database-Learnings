This reppostitary is a documentation of my learnings of Database Management and related concepts.

This whole documentation is majorly based out of the very amazing book by [Martin Kleppmann](https://martin.kleppmann.com/) which is called [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/buy.html).

Apart from the book I have used a lot of articles for deep diving into the topic I felt needed more attention, links for them, I have provided at their respective appearances.
